# The Vault
An NFT storing service. Maybe an NFT Musuem.

Honestly, I'm just learning to store some files and pixels in the backend.

# Running
To install dependencies run `npm install`

To compile the TypeScript to JavaScript run `npm run build` or `npm run clean` for a clean build.

To start the server for production run `npm run start`

To start the servere for development run `npm run dev`
